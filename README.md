# JurassicParkJavaProject
Java project Jurassic Park (Week 9 CodeClan course)

Java project
Mockito used for testing random methods

Things I'd modify:
- Modify dinosaurEscapes method so is only possible if hunger level is higher than that required to just rampage
- Modify dinosaurHitBoundary method to account for possibility of escape after one hit if health brought down to 0 (ie if has not been repaired)
- allow all paddocks to be emptied and improve the Velociraptor callForBackup function.
- PaddockType enum is currently redundant
